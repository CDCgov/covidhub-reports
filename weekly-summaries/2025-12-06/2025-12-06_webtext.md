The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 3700 nationally, with 2200 to 5500 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending December 13, 2025. This is compared to the 3200 admissions reported for the week ending November 29, 2025, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of December 03, 2025. This week, 10 modeling groups contributed 11 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through November 29, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through December 20, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Dakota, Texas, United States, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
