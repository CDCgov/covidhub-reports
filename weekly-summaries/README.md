The following data

* are generated partially from [COVID](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid19-forecast-hub/tree/main/model-output) and [RSV](https://github.com/CDCgov/rsv-forecast-hub/tree/main/model-output) Hub submission.
* are generated partially from [NHSN hospital respiratory data](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/psc/hospital-respiratory-reporting.html) and [NSSP Emergency Department Visits data](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/NSSP-Emergency-Department-Visit-Trajectories-by-St/rdmq-nq56/about_data).
* are used for public forecast visualization.
* follows a particular schema, outlined below.

## Rounding Rules

For `quantile_**_rounded` values, different rounding rules apply based on data type and value:

- **Hospital count data**:
  - values > 1000: rounded to nearest hundreds
  - 10 < values < 1000: rounded to nearest tens
  - values < 10: rounded to nearest integer
- **ED visits proportion data**: rounded to 2 significant figures
