The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 8400 nationally, with 4400 to 13100 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending March 08, 2025. This is compared to the 9600 admissions reported for the week ending February 22, 2025, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of February 26, 2025. This week, 9 modeling groups contributed 10 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through February 22, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through March 15, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
