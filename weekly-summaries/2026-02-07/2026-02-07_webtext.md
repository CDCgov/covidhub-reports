The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 5500 nationally, with 3600 to 8600 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending February 14, 2026. This is compared to the 6100 admissions reported for the week ending January 31, 2026, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of February 04, 2026. This week, 11 modeling groups contributed 12 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through January 31, 2026 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through February 21, 2026.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
