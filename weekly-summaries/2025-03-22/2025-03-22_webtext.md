The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 7300 nationally, with 3800 to 11200 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending March 29, 2025. This is compared to the 8200 admissions reported for the week ending March 15, 2025, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of March 19, 2025. This week, 11 modeling groups contributed 12 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through March 15, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through April 05, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
