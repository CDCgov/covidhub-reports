The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 9000 nationally, with 6000 to 16000 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending September 06, 2025. This is compared to the 8400 admissions reported for the week ending August 23, 2025, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of August 27, 2025. This week, 7 modeling groups contributed 7 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through August 23, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through September 13, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, United States, Virginia, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
