The CovidHub ensemble's one-week-ahead forecast predicts that the number of new weekly laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions will be approximately 4600 nationally, with 3000 to 7600 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions likely reported in the week ending April 26, 2025. This is compared to the 5400 admissions reported for the week ending April 12, 2025, the most recent week of reporting from U.S. hospitals.

Reported and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions as of April 16, 2025. This week, 12 modeling groups contributed 13 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction.

The figure shows the number of new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from August 08, 2020 through April 12, 2025 and forecasted new COVID-19 hospital admissions per week for this week and the next 2 weeks through May 03, 2025.

The following jurisdictions had <80% of hospitals reporting for the most recent week: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, United States, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, and Wyoming. Lower reporting rates could impact forecast validity. Percent of hospitals reporting is calculated based on the number of active hospitals reporting complete data to NHSN for a given reporting week.
